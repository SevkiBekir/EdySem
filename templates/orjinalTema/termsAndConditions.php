            <h3>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
             <p> This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Schooling Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Schooling, as well as Schooling brands, products and services, which we call the “Schooling Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the Schooling Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 13 below. 
             Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Schooling works.
             <p>Because Schooling provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. 
             To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.</p>
